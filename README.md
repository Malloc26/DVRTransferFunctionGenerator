Jupyter Noteboook for my implementation of this paper:
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2016/4547138/ 
"A Clustering-Based Automatic Transfer Function Design for Volume Visualization"

The following modules need to be installed:
```
pip install Concurrent_AP
pip install sklearn
pip install numba
pip install Image
conda install numba
conda install accelerate
```

The program generates the opacity and colour transfer functions, which can then
be used by any rendering program.
